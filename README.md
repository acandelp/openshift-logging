# openshift-logging-

In this guide, we will describe the different logging configurations and installations within OpenShift. 

Basically, we'll divide it into two sections: Logging 5 and Logging 6. In these sections, we will explain the different tools and architectures for installing logging, as well as its configuration files and some more advanced options.

Finally, we'll provide some real-life support cases where troubleshooting or reproduction was necessary to gain logging support knowledge.
